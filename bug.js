This bug occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app. The build process fails with an error message indicating that the Android SDK build tools are missing or incorrectly configured. This happens even if the Android SDK is properly installed and configured, and the necessary environment variables are set correctly. The error message can vary but typically indicates that a specific build tool version is not found.
